		<h1>The Inner Mantle</h1>
		<h3>Interesting facts about the inner mantle</h3>
		<p>This layer is the inner part of the large mantle layer and is about 5,500°F hot. Because heat rises, 
            the hotter rock rises to the top of the outer mantle where it cools and sinks back down into this 
            layer. That is what causes the convection currents which affects the crust layer.
		</p>The inner mantle is also made up of iron, oxygen, silicon, magnesium, and aluminum.
