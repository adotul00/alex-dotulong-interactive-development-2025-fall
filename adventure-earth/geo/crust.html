		<h1>The Crust</h1>
		<h3>Interesting facts about the crust</h3>
		<p>The outermost layer that is visible from space is the crust! Otherwise known as the lithosphere, 
            it is also the coolest and thinnest layer. The way that the mantle below it moves makes this layer 
            move, too, but because the convection currents do not go the same direction, the crust is divided 
            into different sections of varying sizes called plates. The rate at which these plates move is so 
            miniscule for a human to notice in its lifetime, but given time, the appearance of the surface 
            of this planet will not look the way it does today.

		<p>There are two different types of crust, and each have a different composition. The oceanic crust 
            is the thinnest of the two at an average of 5 miles thick and is usually made up of iron, 
            oxygen, silicon, magnesium, and aluminum. Meanwhile, the continental crust varies from about 5 to 45 
            miles thick in areas and is composed of granite, sedimentary rocks (formed by other rocks or 
            living organisms that have long been buried and compacted into the soil), and metamorphic rocks 
            (formed when various rocks are combined by heat, pressure, or both transform them into a new mineral).
