		<h3>Interesting facts about the outer mantle</h3>
		<p>Part of the mantle, this layer varies from 2,500°F to about 5,500°F, and while that is hot, the rock 
            is not fully molten and still has some solid rock near the crust. Whenever a volcano erupts on the 
            crust, the molten lava comes from here.
		</p>The outer mantle is made up of iron, oxygen, silicon, magnesium, and aluminum.
