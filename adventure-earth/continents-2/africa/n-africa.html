        <h1>You fly towards North Africa</h1>
        <h3>What is in North Africa?</h3>
        <p>It is commonly associated closely with the Arab countries to its east due to their influence in the 
            region for centuries. This region was also often in contact with the ancient Roman Empire millenia 
            ago and the ancient Egyptian kingdoms are well known to many humans outside of the region. This 
            knowledge was likely due to the use of writing systems by the civilizations in and around this 
            area compared to most of the continent, giving the humans more understanding of the region’s past.
