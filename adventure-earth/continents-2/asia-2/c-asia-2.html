        <h3>What is in Central Asia?</h3>
        <p>The main connection between each of these countries are that they all formerly 
            were a part of the Soviet Union. It is also one of the least known regions 
            in Asia and even the world. The humans that live in this area are mostly 
            nomadic and have found ways to survive despite the majority of the land 
            being arid.
