        <h1>You fly towards Polynesia</h1>
        <h3>What is in Polynesia?</h3>
        <p>This region covers the most ocean compared to the others but contains mostly islands that are controlled by other 
            countries outside of the continent with a few by either Australia and New Zealand. Its name also means "many islands"
            because of the sheer number of islands here.
