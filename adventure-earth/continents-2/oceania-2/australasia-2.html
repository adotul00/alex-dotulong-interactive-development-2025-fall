        <h3>What is in Australasia?</h3>
        <p>Only two countries are in this region, and they are the most Westernized countries in this region. Both are largely populated 
            by humans with European ancestry, mostly from the United Kingdom, though a resurgence of indigenous culture and the rights 
            of indigenous people has brought up disscussions relating to reverting place and even country names to its original names.
