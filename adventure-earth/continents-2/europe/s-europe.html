        <h3>What is in South Europe?</h3>
        <p>Being mostly surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to its south and the North Atlantic Ocean to the west, this region 
            boasts a large coastline with perfect weather to sit at a beach and relax. Also due to its location, it was known 
            to be where the majority of trade happened, especially after the humans invented ways to traverse over the water. 
            The center of the Catholic religion is also located here, specifically at the Vatican City.
