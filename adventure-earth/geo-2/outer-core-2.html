		<h3>Interesting facts about the outer core</h3>
		<p>Ranging from about 7,000°F to almost 11,000°F, this hot mixture of metals circulates around the inner 
            core of the planet. This constant flow provides the planet its magnetic field, offering it 
            protection from the solar wind coming from the sun.
		</p>The outer core is made up of iron, nickel, sulfur, and oxygen.
