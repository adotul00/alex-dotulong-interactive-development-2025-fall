		<h3>Interesting facts about the inner core</h3>
		<p>With a diameter of about 1,500 miles, the center of the planet is extremely hot at about 9,000°F to almost 
            11,000°F. While it is made up of metals, the pressure from all the other layers pushing back onto it causes 
            it to remain solid.
		</p>The outer core is made up of iron and nickel.
