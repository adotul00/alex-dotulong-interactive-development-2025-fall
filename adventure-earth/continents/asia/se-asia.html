        <h3>What is in Southeast Asia?</h3>
        <p>The majority of this region is covered with water and serves as one of the most important areas for international 
            shipping, especially for goods and resources traveling between East Asia and both West Asia and Europe. It also connects 
            the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean with a vast archipelago comprising of more than 20 thousand islands. Many 
            people also like to visit some of these countries for the plethora of places to explore the ocean, beaches to 
            watch the sun set, and even vast variety of culinary options. This is also one of the most linguistically 
            diverse places on the planet.
