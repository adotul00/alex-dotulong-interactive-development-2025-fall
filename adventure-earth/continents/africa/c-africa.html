        <h3>What is in Central Africa?</h3>
        <p>From the arid Sahara Desert in its northern area to the dense jungles of the Congo, the heart of the 
            African continent is challenged by a large variety of issues. Diamonds are one of the most sought 
            after resourse in the area and has been a difficult stain on this region’s past, especially with 
            the brutal way its colonizers treated the locals. When it comes to traversing the jungles in the 
            south, it often takes a very long time since the creation of permanent infrastructure is difficult 
            and very expensive.
