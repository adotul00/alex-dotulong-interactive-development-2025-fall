        <h3>Quick facts about Africa</h3>
		<p>Africa is home to the vast Sahara Desert accompanied with a lush rainforest further 
            south. Rich in resources, this continent has been taken advantage of by European powers for centuries and even 
			sees some external geopolitical forces to this day. The former colonial powers came, drew borders 
			that did not conform to the way the communities functioned, and left without ensuring that the humans living 
			there were well-equipped to run these "new countries" that had been formed without their consent. This caused for 
			many of the countries here to struggle even after independence.
