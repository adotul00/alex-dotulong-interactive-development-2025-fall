        <h3>What is in Melanesia?</h3>
        <p>Most of the islands in this region are larger, and its name means "black islands." This is most likely because of the 
        skin color of the Melanesian people. The western half of the island of New Guinea is controlled by Indonesia, but 
        because the political country boundaries is often used over cultural boundaries, this island is split between Asia 
        and Oceania.
